# YPN USA App (`app.ypnus.com`)

Product app for mortgage loan officers (MLOs): exclusive ZIP-code territories and an
always-on AI agent that captures, qualifies, routes, and nurtures every borrower.

| Host | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`ypnus.com`](https://ypnus.com) | WordPress marketing, LO signup, Cerebro, SEO content |
| [`app.ypnus.com`](https://app.ypnus.com) | **This Next.js app** (territory checker, intake demo, analytics) |

Built with **Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.

Hostinger restore files for the currently-broken app homepage live in [`hostinger/`](./hostinger/).

## What's inside

**Marketing site (`/`)** — a full conversion-focused landing page:
- Hero with a live **ZIP territory availability checker** (real scarcity → real reason to subscribe)
- Autonomous-agent capabilities + a 3-step "ZIP code → pipeline" explainer
- **Exclusive territory** reservation flow (checks availability, then captures the officer)
- **Ownership / portability** section — keep your leads and site if you switch brokerages
- **Predictive life-event intelligence** (probate / divorce / marriage signals)
- An interactive **mortgage payment calculator**
- Freemium **pricing** (Free → Pro MLO → Brokerage), FAQ, and CTAs

**Working product demo:**
- `/embed/intake` — the borrower intake assistant in an iframe-friendly surface (embed on any MLO site)
- The same assistant runs inline in the homepage "Live demo" section
- `/portal/nurture` — urgency-ranked MLO borrower queue with search, program/state filters, outreach,
  and appointment visibility
- `/tools/equity` — private, borrower-entered home-equity snapshot with optional consented MLO review
- `/mortgage-broker/[city]-[state]` and `/zip/[zipcode]` — curated, source-aware local SEO
  territories (unknown locations 404 rather than generating thin pages)
- `/dashboard/local-seo` — MLO NAP, Google Business Profile, review-feed, and review-link readiness

**Backend (App Router route handlers):**
- `POST /api/intake/tick` — conversational intake engine (short shared goal/amount/timeline/credit/contact flow across all loan programs, scoring, CRM mirroring, officer routing, nurture scheduling)
- `GET  /api/territory/check?zip=NNNNN` — ZIP territory availability
- `POST /api/demo-request` — officer territory reservation / waitlist capture
- `POST /api/property/evaluate` — server-validated equity estimate and optional consented review request
- `GET  /api/calendar/slots`, `POST /api/calendar/book` — consultation booking
- `POST /api/automation/process` — processes due nurture follow-ups
- `GET  /api/analytics/summary` — intake telemetry (also rendered at `/analytics`)
- `POST /api/reviews/request` — accepts an authenticated closing event and hands an honest
  Google review request to the configured SMS/email delivery webhook
- `GET  /local-seo-sitemap.xml` — small sitemap containing only curated local territories

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional; sensible defaults work out of the box
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Configuration

All environment variables are optional — see `.env.example`.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Product app URL for SEO/canonical/sitemap. Defaults to `https://app.ypnus.com`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_SITE_URL` | WordPress marketing host. Defaults to `https://ypnus.com`. |
| `YPNUS_WP_API_BASE` | Live territory/signup REST base. Defaults to `https://ypnus.com/wp-json/ypnus/v1`. |
| `LOANPILOT_DATA_DIR` | Directory for the JSON data snapshot. Defaults to `./data`. Point at a writable path (e.g. `/tmp/ypnus`) on read-only hosts. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signs the `ypnus_session` cookie. Falls back to a secret persisted at `<data dir>/session-secret.key` when unset — fine for local dev, but set this explicitly in production. |
| `YPNUS_SSO_SHARED_SECRET` | Shared secret for the `ypnus.com` → `app.ypnus.com` SSO handoff. Required for `/api/auth/callback` to accept a handoff; see `docs/sso-handoff.md`. |
| `INTAKE_EXTERNAL_WEBHOOK_URL` | If set, completed intakes are POSTed here (Zapier/CRM). |
| `LOANPILOT_DEMO_MODE` / `LOANPILOT_DEMO_DAY_MINUTES` | Compress the multi-day nurture ladder for live demos. |
| `LOCAL_SEO_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | Public origin for local canonical URLs; defaults to `https://ypnus.com`. |
| `MLO_PUBLIC_*` / `MLO_NMLS_ID` | Co-branded public NAP and license fields. Omit a non-public office address. |
| `GBP_PLACE_ID` / `GBP_PROFILE_URL` | Verified Place ID for review links and public GBP listing URL. |
| `GBP_REVIEWS_PROVIDER_URL` / `GBP_REVIEWS_PROVIDER_TOKEN` | Authorized server-side source for dynamic verified review records. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_EMBED_KEY` | Optional browser-restricted key for lazy map embeds. |
| `REVIEW_REQUEST_API_SECRET` | Bearer secret required by the closing-event endpoint in production. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` / `CRON_SECRET` | Required by the lead-ingest, automation, and telemetry APIs (`/api/webhooks/leads`, `/api/automation/process`, `/api/analytics/summary`, `/api/revenue/summary`). Those routes reject all machine callers until one is set. |
| `REVIEW_REQUEST_WEBHOOK_URL` / `REVIEW_REQUEST_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | SMS/email provider handoff for post-closing review messages. |

## Local SEO deployment

The Next.js service is hosted at `app.ypnus.com`, while the requested local pages are intended for
`ypnus.com`. Before indexing, configure WordPress/Hostinger to reverse-proxy these paths to this app:

- `/mortgage-broker/*`
- `/zip/*`
- `/local-seo-sitemap.xml`

Then add `https://ypnus.com/local-seo-sitemap.xml` to the marketing site's sitemap index or Google
Search Console. Do not submit the app-hosted sitemap as a substitute for that marketing-host route.

Location pages are intentionally registry-backed. Add a distinct profile with original copy,
neighborhoods, municipal sources, and dated metric sources before a city or ZIP is generated. Reviews
are omitted from both the page and JSON-LD until a configured provider returns valid records; no
sample testimonials or ratings ship in production. `FinancialService` / `MortgageBroker` JSON-LD is
emitted only when both `MLO_PUBLIC_NAME` and `MLO_NMLS_ID` are configured; otherwise the page uses
neutral `WebPage` structured data.

## Data & persistence

State (sessions, leads, CRM notes, territory reservations, analytics) is held in an
**in-memory store** that is hydrated from and written through to a JSON snapshot on a
best-effort basis. On a persistent Node host (`next start`, a VPS, Docker, Hostinger
Cloud, Render) the JSON snapshot survives restarts. For durable multi-instance
production data, swap the storage layer in `src/lib/db.ts` for a database (Supabase,
Postgres, etc.); a starter schema is in `supabase-leads-schema.sql`.

## Deploy

### Hostinger Cloud (recommended)
Production shape: WordPress marketing on `ypnus.com`, this Next.js product app on
`app.ypnus.com` as a Hostinger **Cloud Node.js web app**. Full checklist:
[`hostinger/README.md`](./hostinger/README.md).

```bash
export HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=…   # hPanel → API
npm run deploy:hostinger:list
npm run deploy:hostinger:next  # builds on app.ypnus.com
```

Or in hPanel: **Websites → Add Website → Node.js web app → Import GitHub**
(`dave4079111/ypnusa`). Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://app.ypnus.com` and the
other vars from `.env.example`. Remove the Cloudflare redirect that currently
sends `app.ypnus.com/` → `ypnus.com/` first.

### Render
A [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) blueprint is included for a persistent Node host:
1. At [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com): **New +  → Blueprint**.
2. Connect the `dave4079111/ypnusa` repo and click **Apply**.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the service's Environment tab.

### Any Node host (VPS / Docker)
```bash
npm ci
npm run build
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain npm run start   # honors $PORT
```
Put it behind a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) and process manager (PM2/systemd). The default
`./data` directory is writable here, so lead data persists across restarts.
