# Hostinger deploy notes — ypnus.com + app.ypnus.com

## Current production shape

| Host | Role | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://ypnus.com` | Marketing, signup, Cerebro, Rank Math SEO | WordPress on Hostinger |
| `https://app.ypnus.com` | Territory product / ZIP inventory | Static HTML (+ WP REST for lock ledger); Next.js ready |

## Critical live bugs found (and fixed)

1. **`app.ypnus.com/` 301 → `ypnus.com/`**  
   Cause was an `.htaccess` rule (`RewriteRule ^$ https://ypnus.com/`) in the app
   document root — not Cloudflare alone. Removed by
   `node scripts/deploy-hostinger.mjs fix-htaccess`. Redeploys can regenerate a
   stale copy; the deploy script strips that rule automatically.

2. **~70k URLs in `app.ypnus.com/sitemap.xml`**  
   Giant programmatic city/ZIP inventory. Matches the GSC “Not indexed” spike on the brand.

3. **WordPress `page-sitemap.xml` includes media URLs**  
   Attachment/image URLs are leaking into the page sitemap via Rank Math — waste crawl budget.

## Restore app homepage (do this first)

1. **Cloudflare** → `ypnus.com` zone → Rules → Redirect Rules / Page Rules:  
   delete any rule that sends `app.ypnus.com` → `ypnus.com`.  
   Or run (with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`):
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-cloudflare-redirect.mjs list
   node scripts/fix-cloudflare-redirect.mjs delete
   ```
2. Upload the contents of `hostinger/app-ypnus/` into the **app.ypnus.com document root**:
   - `index.html` — working ZIP checker against `ypnus.com/wp-json/ypnus/v1/zip-check/{zip}`
   - `.htaccess` — keep the app homepage local
   - `robots.txt` — lean crawl guidance
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   curl -sI https://app.ypnus.com/ | head -5   # expect 200, not 301 to ypnus.com
   curl -s https://ypnus.com/wp-json/ypnus/v1/zip-check/90210 | head -c 200
   curl -sI https://app.ypnus.com/zips/90210/ | head -5
   ```

## WordPress SEO hygiene (ypnus.com)

Upload `wp-plugins/ypnus-seo-hygiene.zip` (or the folder) as a normal plugin and activate it:

- Excludes attachments from Rank Math sitemaps
- noindexes thin utility endpoints that should not compete for indexing
- Documents the marketing vs app host split in `robots.txt`
- Registers `rank_math_title` / `rank_math_description` as REST-editable fields on
  pages and posts, so the app's Website Autopilot can propose and apply Rank Math
  SEO title/description changes via `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/{id}`

Then in Rank Math:

- Turn **off** “Attachments” in sitemap settings if still enabled
- Review `/markets/` and near-duplicate city LO pages; noindex or consolidate thin ones
- Keep conversion URLs: `/check-zip.html`, `/lo-signup.html`, `/pricing-plans/`

## WordPress Stripe webhook (ypnus.com)

Upload `wp-plugins/ypnus-stripe-webhook.zip` as a normal plugin and activate it. Configure the
signing secret and Payment Link / Price ID tier maps directly in `wp-config.php`; never commit or
paste live Stripe secrets into chat. The complete event list and sandbox verification sequence are
documented in `wp-plugins/ypnus-stripe-webhook/README.md`.

## Next.js app on Hostinger Cloud (Node.js web app)

This repo is the **product app** for `https://app.ypnus.com` on a Hostinger
**Cloud** plan (Node.js web apps). WordPress stays on `ypnus.com` for marketing/SEO.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Plan | Hostinger Cloud (Startup / Professional / Enterprise) |
| Application type | `next` (auto-detected) |
| Node.js | 22 |
| Build script | `build` |
| Start script | `start` (`next start -H 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT`) |
| Output directory | `.next` |
| `output` in `next.config.ts` | `standalone` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://app.ypnus.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_SITE_URL` | `https://ypnus.com` |
| `YPNUS_WP_API_BASE` | `https://ypnus.com/wp-json/ypnus/v1` |
| `LOANPILOT_DATA_DIR` | `/tmp/ypnus-data` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | random 32+ byte string — signs the `ypnus_session` cookie |
| `YPNUS_SSO_SHARED_SECRET` | random secret shared with the WordPress SSO handoff (see `docs/sso-handoff.md`) |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` / `CRON_SECRET` | optional bearer secrets for machine-only endpoints (`/api/webhooks/leads`, `/api/automation/process`); `/api/analytics/summary` and `/api/revenue/summary` also accept either one **or** a valid `ypnus_session` cookie |

Stripe billing lives entirely on `ypnus.com` — see "WordPress Stripe webhook" below. There is
no `STRIPE_*` env var on this app; an earlier app-side webhook (`/api/billing/checkout`,
`/api/webhooks/stripe`) was removed in favor of it.

## Session / SSO architecture

`ypnus.com` is public marketing + MLO lead-capture only. Authenticated sessions and
dashboard routes (`/dashboard`, `/portal`, `/analytics`, `/admin`) live exclusively on
`app.ypnus.com`, gated by `src/proxy.ts` and a host-only `ypnus_session` cookie that is
never shared with `ypnus.com`. Full handoff contract: `docs/sso-handoff.md`.

## Marketing lead capture (ypnus.com → app.ypnus.com)

`ypnus.com`'s marketing forms should post directly to **`app.ypnus.com/api/demo-request`**
(CORS-enabled for `https://ypnus.com`, `OPTIONS` preflight included) rather than a new
endpoint — it already validates, rate-limits, checks territory availability, and persists
the lead. There's no need for a separate `/api/webhooks/mlo-leads`; that would just
duplicate this logic.

## Stripe billing — lives on WordPress, not this app

`ypnus.com`'s **`ypnus-stripe-webhook`** plugin (`wp-plugins/ypnus-stripe-webhook.zip`) is
the real Stripe receiver: `POST https://ypnus.com/wp-json/ypnus/v1/stripe-webhook`. It
verifies signatures, atomically claims events (idempotent under Stripe retries), resolves
the tier from Payment Link/Price metadata, provisions a WordPress user, and stores
`ypnus_tier` / `ypnus_paid_access` / `ypnus_stripe_*` on that user. See
`wp-plugins/ypnus-stripe-webhook/README.md` for the full setup (webhook secret and tier
maps go in `wp-config.php` — never in chat or source control).

An earlier app-side Stripe webhook (`/api/webhooks/stripe`, `/api/billing/checkout`) was
removed to avoid two systems processing the same Stripe events with different entitlement
state. If a future need arises for app.ypnus.com to know a user's paid tier (e.g. to gate a
dashboard feature), pass `tier` / `subscription_status` through as claims on the SSO
handoff (`docs/sso-handoff.md`) rather than re-deriving it from a second webhook.

### Option A — hPanel GitHub deploy (recommended)
1. Remove the Cloudflare redirect (above).
2. If `app.ypnus.com` is still a static/PHP site, remove that website slot first
   (download a backup), then **Websites → Add Website → Node.js web app**.
3. Import `dave4079111/ypnusa`, set the env vars above, deploy branch `main`
   (or this PR branch for a preview).

### Option B — API archive deploy
```bash
export HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=…   # hPanel → API
npm run deploy:hostinger:list
npm run deploy:hostinger:next          # defaults to app.ypnus.com
npm run deploy:hostinger:status
```

The script uploads a source zip (no `node_modules` / `.next`), starts the Cloud
Node.js build, and streams logs until completion. Set the env vars in hPanel
afterward and **Restart** the Node process.

### Option C — Render blueprint
[`render.yaml`](../render.yaml) still works as a Node host; point DNS for
`app.ypnus.com` at the Render service after the Cloudflare redirect is gone.
